title: Ubuntu vs Debian
---
These only apply to me and have been tested on the same hardware - results may vary!
### Ubuntu 14.04 advantages:

- Boots faster
- Better font layout
- Nice integration of menu bar
- More support
- More recent software with bug fixes

### Debian Wheezy advantages

- More stable (most of the time)
- Much better at dealing with crashes. When Debian crashes, e.g. if you run {% highlight python %}a = [1]*500000000{% endhighlight %} in Python, the computer becomes less responsive, but Ctrl-Alt-F1 still works
- Can customise Gnome more than Unity
- Doesn't come with marketing content
- Less controlling, e.g. Ubuntu won't let you set Grub timeout to 0 without a hack
